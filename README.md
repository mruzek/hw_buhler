# HwBuhler

BÃ¼hler engineers finished a prototype of a line-machine (production line) for products bagging (put rice, sugar, or
wheat in bags), the line consists of following sections (machines)
- Scale
- Bag Attach
- Packer
- Bag Closer
Every Machine in the line has one of the following states during the running time:
- Running
- Alarm
- Warning
Every state has an icon and color (used icons are google icons )
Your Task:
- Create an Angular application which shows the machines of the line in 2 places (navigation & overview)
where user can see the state of every section.
- Machines data can be stored in .json file (Optional)
